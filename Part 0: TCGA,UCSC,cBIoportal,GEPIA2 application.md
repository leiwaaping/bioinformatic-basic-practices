### The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA)
>The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a landmark cancer genomics program, molecularly characterized over 20,000 primary cancer and matched normal samples spanning 33 cancer types. This joint effort between the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute began in 2006, bringing together researchers from diverse disciplines and multiple institutions.Over the next dozen years, TCGA generated over 2.5 petabytes of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data. The data, which has already lead to improvements in our ability to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer, will remain publicly available for anyone in the research community to use.

******************************************************** 

Q1: How many cases are involved in TCGA database? How many projects?  

Q2: How many primary site involved in TCGA database, why the cases size are different amoung various primary sites?   

Q3: what are the difference between projects,cases and files?  (click "Repository" to see more)  

***********************************************************  

**Task1: Find projects about breast cancer RNA-seq cohort.**  
"project" —— select "breast" in *Primary Site* and "RNA-seq" in *Experimental Strategy*  
In the end there are 6 projects (1700+ cases).

**Task2: Find a WGS mutation information (vcf files) from brain cancer case(age from 20 to 40).**  
"Repository" —— "case" —— select "brain" in *Primary Site* ——set age in *Age at Diagnosis*
