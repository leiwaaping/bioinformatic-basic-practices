### introduction
*UNIX* is an operating system which was first developed in the 1960s, and has been under constant development ever since.  
*Linux* is an entire family of open-source Unix operating systems, that are based on the Linux Kernel. This includes all of the most popular Linux based systems like Ubuntu, Fedora, Mint, Debian, and others. More accurately, they’re called distributions or distros.  
The *shell* acts as an interface between the user and the kernel. Most Linux distributions use a graphic user interface (GUI) as their shell, mainly to provide ease of use for their users，like virtual machine with linux system.  But here we highly recommend using a command-line interface (CLI) because it’s more powerful and effective. Tasks that require a multi-step process through GUI can be done in a matter of seconds by typing commands into the CLI.  The CLI can be easily get access to by Terminal in Mac and Putty/Xshell (install required) in Windows.
